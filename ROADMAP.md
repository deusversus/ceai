# CE AI Suite — Project Roadmap

**Derived from:** [PROJECT-REVIEW.md](PROJECT-REVIEW.md) (full project review against CE 7.5 baseline)  
**UI Blueprint:** Session files/UI-DESIGN.md (comprehensive layout spec with tool→UI mappings)  
**Baseline:** Early Alpha (v0.2–0.3), ~25K LOC, 65 tests, ~21% AI↔UI tool parity  
**Goal:** Production-quality memory analysis workstation with full AI integration and manual UI parity

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **AI-first, user-parity goal** — Every capability is built for the AI operator first, then surfaced in manual UI. The app must be fully functional without AI.
2. **No orphan tools** — If it's in `AiToolFunctions.cs`, it needs a UI surface (window, panel, context menu, or toolbar button).
3. **Incremental delivery** — Each phase ships a usable improvement. No "big bang" rewrites.
4. **Preserve what works** — The AI integration (rated 95%) and architecture (rated 75%) are strengths. Don't break them.

**All Phase 2 items complete.**

---

## Phase 2.5: Architectural Refactor (MVVM + DI) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Extract the 3,800+ line MainWindow.xaml.cs into ViewModels with dependency injection before Phase 3 adds ~2,000 more lines. This is a prerequisite — not a nice-to-have.

**Result:** 18 ViewModels extracted (7 more than the 11 planned). DI fully wired in App.xaml.cs with 30+ services registered. MainWindow.xaml.cs reduced to ~1,250 lines (AvalonDock framework wiring). INavigationService, IDialogService, IClipboardService, IDispatcherService all implemented. CommunityToolkit.Mvvm used throughout. ViewModel test coverage at ~55%.

### 2.5A — DI Container & Service Registration

### 9A — Dependency Injection ← MOVED to Phase 2.5

*DI and MVVM refactor promoted to Phase 2.5 as a prerequisite for Phase 3. See Phase 2.5A for details.*

### 9B — CI/CD Pipeline (Review §4, §8 #10 High)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| GitHub Actions workflow | Build + test on push/PR |
| Automated test execution | All 65+ xUnit tests run on every commit |
| Release builds | Automated publish to GitHub Releases |
| Code coverage reporting | Track coverage trends |

### 9C — Logging & Telemetry (Review §4 Weakness)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Structured logging (Serilog) | Replace `Debug.WriteLine` with proper structured logging |
| File sink | Log to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CEAISuite\logs\` |
| Output panel integration | Route log events to the Output tab |
| Optional crash reporting | Opt-in error telemetry for field debugging |

### 9D — Testing Expansion (Review §5: 50% → target 70%)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Integration tests | Test full AI→Engine→Memory pipelines with mock processes |
| UI automation tests | Basic smoke tests for window lifecycle |
| Scan engine benchmarks | Performance regression tests for scanning |
| CT import/export round-trip tests | Ensure CE table compatibility |

### 9E — UX Gaps (discovered during Phase 2 audit)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Progress indicators | Spinners/progress bars for scans, breakpoint operations, snapshot captures. Status text alone isn't enough visual feedback for long operations. |
| First-run experience | Onboarding dialog for new users — attach walkthrough, scan tutorial, AI operator intro. Empty state currently gives no guidance. |
| Auto-update mechanism | Check for updates on startup, notify user. No silent updates — user-controlled. |
| Crash recovery | Auto-save address table periodically. On crash, offer to restore last session. |

### 9F — Dependency Hygiene (discovered during Phase 2 audit)

| Item | Risk | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI | Medium | Pre-release (1.0.0-rc4) — monitor for breaking API changes. Pin version, test on upgrade. |
| keystoneengine.csharp | Low | NuGet binding from 2018. Works fine but no upstream maintenance. Consider vendoring if issues arise. |

---

## Phase 10: Advanced Features & Ecosystem

**Goal:** Long-term features that bring CE AI Suite toward full CE parity and beyond. Organized into 9 sub-phases ordered by feasibility and impact.

**Complexity key:** Low · Medium · Medium-High · High · Very High

---

### Phase 10A — Plugin System UI ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Surface the already-built `PluginHost`/`ICeaiPlugin` backend (in `AgentLoop/PluginSystem.cs`) with a first-class management UI so users can install, browse, and unload community plugins.

**Why:** The engine is 100% done. This sub-phase costs minimal work and immediately unlocks the community ecosystem.

**Result:** PluginManagerViewModel with plugin discovery, catalog refresh, install from disk and online catalog. PluginHost promoted to DI singleton with AssemblyLoadContext isolation. AI tools: `ListPlugins`, `GetPluginTools`.

**Complexity:** Low

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| `PluginManagerService` | Thin observable wrapper around `PluginHost`; exposes `LoadedPlugins`, `InstallFromFileAsync`, `UnloadAsync` |
| `PluginManagerViewModel` | `ObservableCollection<PluginDisplayItem>` with `InstallCommand`, `UnloadCommand`, `OpenPluginDirectoryCommand`, `RefreshCommand` |
| `PluginManagerPanel.xaml` | New left-sidebar anchorable panel (alongside Modules/Threads/Memory Map/Workspace); shows name, version, description, tool count, status |
| `LayoutVersion` bump | `19` → `20` |
| AI tools (`AiToolFunctions.Plugins.cs`) | `ListPlugins()` `[ReadOnly]`, `GetPluginTools(pluginName)` `[ReadOnly]` |
| DI | `AddSingleton<PluginManagerService>()`, `AddSingleton<PluginManagerViewModel>()` — promote `PluginHost` to DI singleton |
| Tests | `PluginManagerViewModelTests.cs` — load/unload/error states with mock `PluginHost` |

---

### Phase 10B — Trainer Generation GUI ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Build a dialog that takes selected address table entries and emits a standalone `.exe` trainer that locks values in the target process while running — CE's most visible "killer app" feature.

**Approach:** Roslyn `CSharpCompilation` generates a self-contained C# source using P/Invoke `WriteProcessMemory` in a loop, compiled in-process to a `.exe`. No dotnet SDK required on end-user machines.

**Result:** `RoslynTrainerCompiler` generates + compiles C# trainer source via Roslyn. `TrainerGeneratorDialog.xaml` with entry checklist, preview source, and build button. AI tools: `GenerateTrainer`, `PreviewTrainerSource`.

**Complexity:** Medium

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| `TrainerContracts.cs` (Abstractions) | `TrainerEntry`, `TrainerConfig`, `TrainerBuildResult` records; `ITrainerGeneratorService` interface |
| `RoslynTrainerGeneratorService` (Application) | Generates + compiles C# trainer source via Roslyn; `PreviewSource()` for "View Source" button |
| `TrainerGeneratorDialog.xaml` | Entry checklist (pre-populated from selection), target process, title, refresh interval slider (50–1000ms), Preview Source button, Build Trainer button with progress bar |
| Tools menu entry | `Tools` menu → "Generate Trainer…" |
| `AiToolFunctions.Trainer.cs` | `GenerateTrainer(title, entryIds[], outputPath)` `[Destructive]`, `PreviewTrainerSource(entryIds[])` `[ReadOnly]` |
| NuGet | `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp` added to `CEAISuite.Application.csproj` |
| DI | `AddSingleton<ITrainerGeneratorService, RoslynTrainerGeneratorService>()` |
| Tests | `TrainerGeneratorServiceTests.cs` — verify generated source compiles cleanly via `CSharpCompilation.Emit`; no runtime execution in unit tests |

---

### Phase 10C — AI Co-Pilot Mode ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Allow the AI to issue whitelisted UI commands — navigate to a panel, populate scan forms, set address entry values, attach a process — as staged actions shown to the user before execution. Strictly MVVM command invocation through a defined whitelist; not general UI automation.

**Why now:** Phase 2.5 built MVVM specifically for this. `PermissionEngine`, `HookRegistry`, `SkillSystem`, and `AgentStreamEvent.ApprovalRequested` all exist and are waiting for this wiring.

**Result:** `UiCommandBus` with whitelist enforcement, thread-safe dispatch, and ViewModel subscriptions. AI tools: `GetUiCommandWhitelist`, `ExecuteUiCommand`. Settings toggle for approval requirements.

**Complexity:** Medium

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| `IUiCommandBus` + command records (Application) | `NavigatePanelCommand`, `PopulateScanFormCommand`, `AddEntryToTableCommand`, `SetEntryValueCommand`, `AttachProcessCommand`; `UiCommandWhitelist` static set |
| `UiCommandBus` implementation | `Dispatch(UiCommand)` + `CommandReceived` event; ViewModels subscribe in constructor |
| ViewModel subscriptions | `ScannerViewModel`, `AddressTableViewModel`, `INavigationService` handle their respective commands |
| `AiToolFunctions.CoPilot.cs` | `GetUiCommandWhitelist()` `[ReadOnly]`, `ExecuteUiCommand(commandType, parametersJson)` `[Destructive]` → routes through `PermissionEngine` → triggers `ApprovalRequested`, `GetCurrentUiState()` `[ReadOnly]` |
| Settings page | "AI Co-Pilot" section: enable/disable toggle, per-command-type whitelist checkboxes, "Require approval for all co-pilot actions" toggle |
| AI panel badge | "Co-Pilot" mode indicator in AI Operator panel when active |
| DI | `AddSingleton<IUiCommandBus, UiCommandBus>()` |
| Tests | `UiCommandBusTests.cs` — dispatch, whitelist enforcement, unknown command rejection; `AiToolFunctionsCopilotTests.cs` — verify approval flow triggered |

---

### Phase 10D — Speed Hack ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Intercept and scale `timeGetTime`, `QueryPerformanceCounter`, `GetTickCount`, and optionally `Sleep` to slow or accelerate game timers. No kernel required.

**Approach:** Initially implemented as IAT patching, but **rewritten to inline hooking** after IAT patching failed on real games (forwarding stubs, delay-loaded DLLs, and multi-module IAT tables made IAT-only approaches unreliable). The final implementation uses Iced disassembler for instruction boundary detection and RIP-relative relocation, with fixed-point scaling in injected trampolines. Removal sets multiplier to 1.0× before unhooking to prevent timing discontinuities.

**Complexity:** Medium-High

**Lessons learned:** IAT patching alone is insufficient for production use — games load timing functions through forwarding stubs, delay-load tables, and statically linked CRT copies that bypass the IAT. Inline hooking at the function entry point is the only reliable approach. Thread suspension during unhooking causes input freezes; ramping to 1.0× then unhooking without suspension is the correct removal sequence.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| `SpeedHackContracts.cs` (Abstractions) | `SpeedHackConfig` (multiplier, per-function toggles), `SpeedHackState`, `ISpeedHackEngine` |
| `WindowsSpeedHackEngine` (Engine.Windows) | Inline hooking with Iced decoder for instruction boundaries + RIP-relative relocation; follows forwarding stubs before hooking; fixed-point multiplier scaling |
| `SpeedHackService` (Application) | Rate-limit guards, state tracking, safe apply/remove |
| `SpeedHackViewModel` (Desktop) | Speed slider (0.1×–8.0×), multiplier readout, per-function toggles, Apply/Remove buttons, anti-cheat warning label |
| UI placement | New bottom panel tab or toolbar popout |
| `AiToolFunctions.SpeedHack.cs` | `GetSpeedHackState(processId)` `[ReadOnly]`, `SetSpeedMultiplier(processId, multiplier)` `[Destructive]`, `RemoveSpeedHack(processId)` `[Destructive]` |
| DI | `AddSingleton<ISpeedHackEngine, WindowsSpeedHackEngine>()`, `AddSingleton<SpeedHackService>()`, `AddSingleton<SpeedHackViewModel>()` |
| Tests | `SpeedHackServiceTests.cs` — unit tests with mock engine; integration test against `TestHarnessProcess` measuring tick delta before/after 0.5× |

---

### Phase 10E — VEH Debugging ✅ COMPLETE (Overhauled)

**Goal:** Add a Vectored Exception Handler-based debugger mode that intercepts hardware breakpoints (`EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP` via Trap Flag, `EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT` via INT3) without `DebugActiveProcess` attachment — bypassing common anti-debug checks (`IsDebuggerPresent`, `NtQueryInformationProcess(ProcessDebugPort)`).

**Approach:** Native C VEH agent DLL injected via `loadlibrary`/`createthread` infrastructure. Communicates via shared memory IPC (V2 protocol). `BreakpointMode` enum gains a `VEH` option. CI workflow compiles both x64 and x86 agent DLLs with MSVC.

**Result:** Comprehensive VEH debugging system overhauled across 7 sub-phases (A–G), each independently audited and hardened. Native agent ~1,500 LOC, total VEH codebase ~5,000 LOC across 15 files. 100+ dedicated VEH tests.

**Complexity:** High

**Sub-phase A — Core Protocol Hardening ✅**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| IPC V2 protocol | Ring buffer expanded 256→4096 with overflow detection counter |
| hitType bug fix | DR6-based slot lookup populates correct BP type (was always 0) |
| Variable data watch sizes | 1/2/4/8 bytes via DR7 LEN encoding + `commandArg3` field |
| WOW64 support | Conditional compilation for x86 registers; CI builds both x64 + x86 agent DLLs |
| New thread detection | `CMD_REFRESH_THREADS` command + periodic 500ms auto-refresh for new threads |
| Agent health monitoring | Heartbeat field in shared memory; Healthy/Unresponsive status |
| Command serialization | Per-process `SemaphoreSlim(1,1)` prevents concurrent command corruption |

**Sub-phase B — Conditional Breakpoints + Lua Callbacks ✅**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| `VehConditionEvaluator` | Host-side evaluation: register compare (`RAX == 0x100`), hit count (`> 10`, `% 100`), memory compare (`0x1000 == 0x42` via `ReadProcessMemory`) |
| Lua integration | `ILuaScriptEngine` injected via DI; per-DR-slot callback registration; fire-and-forget with fault observation |
| Condition filtering | Non-matching hits consumed but not yielded from `GetHitStreamAsync` |

**Sub-phase C — Anti-Detection Stealth ✅**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| DR register cloaking | Inline hook on `NtGetThreadContext` (ntdll) zeros DR0-DR7 in returned CONTEXT; register-preserving `JMP [RIP+0]` trampoline; prologue validation before hooking; thread suspension during patch |
| PEB module hiding | Unlinks agent from InLoadOrder/InMemoryOrder/InInitializationOrder lists with `LdrLockLoaderLock`; saved pointers for clean re-link before `FreeLibrary` |
| DLL name obfuscation | Randomized innocuous filename (`msvcrt_p140_{guid}.dll`) |

**Sub-phase D — VEH UI Panel ✅**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| `VehDebugViewModel` | ObservableObject with RelayCommands for all operations; background hit stream with `CancellationTokenSource` lifecycle |
| `VehDebugPanel` | Dockable bottom panel: Inject/Eject/Stealth buttons, breakpoint DataGrid, real-time hit stream ListView (virtualized, capped at 500) |
| Menu entries | Added hamburger menu entries for Speed Hack + VEH Debugger (were previously missing) |

**Sub-phase E — Dynamic Tracing via Trap Flag ✅**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Trace commands | `CMD_START_TRACE(maxSteps, threadFilter)` / `CMD_STOP_TRACE` |
| VEH handler | DR6 bit 14 (BS) check for trace steps; TF re-armed until maxSteps exhausted; orphaned TF safely consumed |
| Managed engine | `TraceFromBreakpointAsync` with adaptive timeout; `VehTraceResult`/`VehTraceEntry` records |

**Sub-phase F — Unified Breakpoint Pipeline ✅**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| First-class VEH mode | `BreakpointMode.VectoredExceptionHandler` routes through `IVehDebugger` in `WindowsBreakpointEngine` |
| Auto-inject | Agent injected automatically on first VEH breakpoint |
| Auto-fallback chain | Hardware → VEH → PageGuard (VEH tried before PageGuard since it doesn't need debugger) |
| Unified list/remove | VEH BPs appear in `ListBreakpointsAsync` and support standard `RemoveBreakpointAsync` |

**Sub-phase G — Page Guard + INT3 through VEH ✅**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| PAGE_GUARD via VEH | `CMD_SET_PAGE_GUARD`/`CMD_REMOVE_PAGE_GUARD`; VEH catches `STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION`; per-entry `pendingRearm` for targeted re-arm; up to 64 concurrent |
| INT3 via VEH | `CMD_SET_INT3`/`CMD_REMOVE_INT3`; VEH catches `EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT`; original byte restore + IP backup + TF re-arm cycle; up to 64 concurrent |
| No DR slot limit | Page Guard and INT3 breakpoints don't consume hardware debug register slots |

**Audit results:** All 7 sub-phases independently audited. 30+ issues found (5 critical, 12 medium), all fixed: trampoline RAX clobber, command race condition, ring buffer overwrite, orphaned TF crash, stale re-arm on slot reuse, and more.

---

### ~~Phase 10F — D3D/OpenGL Overlay~~ → Demoted to Phase 11 / Community Plugin

**Original goal:** In-game value overlay via `IDXGISwapChain::Present` vtable hooking.

**Why demoted:** Very High complexity (vtable hooks, native DLL, IPC) with the highest crash risk of any feature, and the use case is largely obsoleted by multi-monitor setups. CE AI Suite on a second monitor provides the same information with zero injection risk and zero anti-cheat exposure. If a user needs an overlay, the plugin system (10A) provides the extension point for a community-contributed implementation.

**Status:** Deferred to Phase 11 or community plugin. Design spec preserved above for reference.

---

### Phase 10G — Community Distribution ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Complete the ecosystem story: versioned releases with a hosted update manifest, a `ceai://install-plugin?url=...` URI scheme for community catalog installs, and a GitHub Pages portal.

**Result:** `PluginCatalogService` fetches catalog from GitHub Pages with SHA256 verification and HTTPS enforcement. `ceai://install-plugin` protocol handler wired in `App.xaml.cs`. Online catalog tab in Plugin Manager.

**Complexity:** Low *(almost entirely DevOps + web)*

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/update-manifest.yml` | On release, publish `update.json` to GitHub Pages |
| `scripts/publish-manifest.ps1` | Generates `update.json` from release assets (version, download URL, SHA256) |
| `PluginCatalogService` (Application) | Fetches community catalog JSON from GitHub Pages; `FetchCatalogAsync()`, `DownloadAndVerifyAsync()` |
| `PluginCatalogViewModel` (Desktop) | Extends `PluginManagerViewModel` (10A) with "Online Catalog" tab: community plugins with Install button |
| `ceai://` protocol handler | `.reg` script in `scripts/`; `App.xaml.cs` startup args parsing triggers catalog install |
| DI | `AddSingleton<PluginCatalogService>()` |
| Tests | Mock `HttpClient` in `PluginCatalogServiceTests.cs`; extend `UpdateServiceTests.cs` for manifest schema validation; no live network calls in CI |
| Dependencies | Requires 10A (Plugin Manager UI) |

---

### ~~Phase 10H — Multi-Platform Exploration~~ → Demoted to Phase 11

**Original goal:** Audit abstraction layer portability and build a `CEAISuite.Engine.Linux` stub.

**Why demoted:** The target audience debugs Windows game processes. Linux/macOS users running games through Wine/Proton are a tiny niche with fundamentally different process model challenges. Being Windows-only is not a limitation for this product category. Multi-platform is a "cherry on top" after the core product is complete, not a prerequisite.

**Portability assessment (preserved for future reference):**

| Layer | Portability | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `Engine.Abstractions` | 100% portable | No OS-specific types |
| `Engine.Lua` | 100% portable | MoonSharp is pure C# |
| `Application` | ~90% portable | Only `IScreenCaptureEngine` + `GlobalHotkeyService` use Windows APIs |
| `Engine.Windows` | 0% portable | All P/Invoke |
| `Desktop` (WPF) | 0% portable | Would need Avalonia or MAUI replacement |

---

### Phase 10I — Kernel-Mode Debugging *(Phase 11 candidate)*

**Goal:** A signed Windows kernel driver (`CEAISuiteKm.sys`) providing ring-0 capabilities: bypass `ObRegisterCallbacks`-based access restrictions, bypass anti-debug checks at the kernel level, optional SSDT interception.

**This item is listed for completeness but is recommended as Phase 11.** Prerequisites beyond the current team's scope:
- EV code signing certificate (~$500/year + token)
- Dedicated kernel developer familiar with WDK and Windows internals
- Per-Windows-version offset tables for SSDT/`DbgkpXxx` structures
- CI/CD pipeline for kernel binary signing and release
- Compliance review (many anti-cheats blacklist known driver names/hashes)

**Complexity:** Very High

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| `CEAISuite.KernelDriver/` | WDK C project (not C#); three IOCTLs: `OPEN_PROTECTED_PROCESS`, `READ_MEMORY`, `WRITE_MEMORY` |
| `KernelContracts.cs` (Abstractions) | `IKernelDebugger` interface |
| `WindowsKernelBridge` (Engine.Windows) | User-mode bridge communicating with driver via `DeviceIoControl` |
| `KernelDebugService` (Application) | Extends `BreakpointService` with kernel-mode path |
| **Recommendation** | Do not begin until 10A–10H are complete and a kernel engineer is available |

---

### Phase 10J — Adversarial Robustness & Battle Testing ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Systematically harden every engine interface against real-world hostile conditions — processes that exit mid-operation, memory protection changes, malformed inputs, concurrent access, and edge-case Win32 error codes. Transform the test suite from "validates happy paths with mocks" to "proves the engine survives anything a real target throws at it."

**Why this is critical:** Phases 1–9 were built at high velocity with AI assistance. The code is structurally correct and compiles, but the mock-based test suite cannot catch failures that only occur in live adversarial conditions. This phase bridges that gap before Tier 2/3 features (speed hack, VEH) add more injection surface area.

**Result:** Adversarial test harness with hostile behaviors. Fault injection tests for all Win32 error codes. Malformed CT corpus tests (XXE, Billion Laughs, deep nesting, encoding). Concurrent tool stress tests. Dedicated CI job (`adversarial`) runs on every push.

**Complexity:** Medium

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Adversarial test harness process** | New `CEAISuite.Tests.AdversaryHarness` project — a purpose-built .exe that deliberately exhibits hostile behavior: rapidly changing values (1ms timer), pointer chains that re-allocate periodically, regions alternating `PAGE_READWRITE`/`PAGE_NOACCESS`, threads triggering `EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP`, AOB signatures that relocate every 5s |
| **Engine fault injection tests** | For each `I*Engine` method: enumerate every Win32 error code the underlying P/Invoke can return (`ERROR_PARTIAL_COPY`, `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`, `STATUS_PROCESS_IS_TERMINATING`, etc.) and write a test for each. Verify graceful degradation, not crashes. |
| **Process-disappears-mid-scan** | Start a scan, kill the harness process mid-way, verify `ScanService` returns partial results + error status (no `AccessViolationException` escaping to UI) |
| **Memory protection race** | `QueryMemoryProtection` returns RW, harness flips to `PAGE_GUARD` before `ReadMemory`, verify engine catches `STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION` |
| **Breakpoint flood test** | Set BP on a hot-path function (10K+ calls/sec), verify hit log rate-limits and does not OOM or deadlock the UI thread |
| **Malformed CT corpus** | Collect 50+ real-world `.CT` files from CE forums; parse all, verify no unhandled exceptions (encoding issues, missing tags, Lua syntax errors, references to nonexistent modules) |
| **Concurrent AI tool stress** | Dispatch `ScanForPointers` + `WriteMemory` + `DissectStructure` simultaneously against the harness; verify no data races or deadlocks |
| **CI integration** | Harness .exe built as a second project; CI launches it, runs adversarial test suite, kills it on completion. Separate GitHub Actions job with `continue-on-error: false` |

**AI workflow for ongoing robustness:**
1. For each new engine feature, AI generates adversarial test cases alongside implementation
2. CI runs adversarial suite on every push (not just unit tests)
3. Periodic "chaos audit" — AI reviews each `I*Engine` interface for uncovered failure modes and extends the harness

---

### Phase 10K — Security Review Checkpoint ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Audit the supply-chain and injection attack surfaces introduced by the plugin system (10A), community catalog downloads (10G), and DLL injection infrastructure (10D/10E) before community distribution goes live.

**Why:** The combination of "download DLLs from a catalog" + "load them into the app process" + "inject code into target processes" is a textbook supply-chain attack vector. This checkpoint ensures the architecture is secure before external users depend on it.

**Result:** `SECURITY.md` threat model with trust boundaries and mitigations. PID validation guards on all engine operations. Catalog SHA256 checksum enforcement. CT Lua execution warnings. Security validation test suite (`SecurityValidationTests.cs`, `CredentialSecurityTests.cs`).

**Complexity:** Low-Medium *(audit + targeted hardening, not a rewrite)*

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Plugin DLL signing | Plugins must be signed (or at minimum SHA256-verified against the catalog manifest) before `PluginHost.LoadAsync` accepts them |
| Catalog HTTPS + pinning | `PluginCatalogService` must enforce HTTPS and optionally pin the GitHub Pages TLS certificate |
| Sandbox audit | Verify `ICeaiPlugin` interface does not expose raw `IServiceProvider` or allow plugins to resolve security-sensitive services (process handles, file system access beyond plugin directory) |
| Lua sandbox escape review | Re-audit MoonSharp `Preset_HardSandbox` — verify no `os`, `io`, `loadfile`, `dofile`, `debug` library access. Extend `LuaSandboxEscapeTests.cs` with latest known escape vectors |
| Injection code audit | Review all `CreateRemoteThread` + `LoadLibrary` call sites for injection into unintended processes. Verify `SpeedHackEngine` and `VehDebugger` validate `processId` against attached process only |
| CT Lua execution | Review `CheatTableFile.LuaScript` auto-execution — should it prompt the user before running Lua from an imported CT file? (Currently auto-runs; this may need a consent gate) |
| Report | Produce `SECURITY.md` documenting the threat model, trust boundaries, and mitigations |

**Timing:** Run after 10A + 10G are built, before community catalog goes live.

---

### Phase 10L — Stabilization Pass ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Regression benchmark and stability verification gate between Tier 2 and Tier 3 features. After speed hack (10D) adds inline hooking and before VEH debugging (10E) adds exception handler injection, verify the engine hasn't regressed.

**Result:** Scan benchmarks, 100-cycle attach/detach leak detection, speed hack apply/remove resource leak checks, crash recovery stress tests. Dedicated CI job (`stabilization`) runs on every push. Leak tests use behavioral deltas (not hard GC thresholds) for CI stability.

**Complexity:** Low

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Benchmark regression | Run `ScanBenchmarkTests.cs` thresholds against the adversarial harness (10J) with speed hack active — verify scan performance doesn't regress >10% |
| Memory leak check | Attach/detach cycle 100× against harness; verify no handle leaks (`Process.HandleCount` delta ≤ 2) |
| Crash recovery stress | Force-kill the app 10× during active scans/breakpoints; verify crash recovery (`recovery.json`) restores address table every time |
| CI gate | Stabilization tests must pass before 10E/10F branches can merge |

---

## Phase 11: Full Debugger & Kernel Access

**Goal:** Complete the last two major parity gaps — interactive debugger stepping and kernel-mode access for anti-debug bypass.

### Phase 11A — Debugger Stepping ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Wire the stubbed Step In/Over/Out/Continue buttons in the Debugger tab to a real stepping engine. This is the last major CE parity gap that affects every user.

**Result:** `ISteppingEngine` + `WindowsSteppingEngine` using VEH TF single-step (`maxSteps=1`). `SteppingService` with PID validation. 5 AI tools (`StepIn`, `StepOver`, `StepOut`, `ContinueExecution`, `GetSteppingState`). `DebuggerViewModel` wired with async stepping, register display, step history, and call stack refresh. Lua bindings: `debug_stepIn/Over/Out/continue/continueFromBreakpoint`. `StepCompletedEvent` added to event bus. 22 new tests (13 engine + 9 service). 2,947 total tests.

**Complexity:** High

| Item | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| `ISteppingEngine` (Abstractions) | ✅ Done | `StepInAsync`, `StepOverAsync`, `StepOutAsync`, `ContinueAsync`, `GetState`, `GetCurrentStateAsync` |
| `StepResult` / `SteppingState` / `StoppedReason` | ✅ Done | Records in `SteppingContracts.cs` |
| `StepCompletedEvent` | ✅ Done | Added to `BreakpointEventContracts.cs` |
| `WindowsSteppingEngine` (Engine.Windows) | ✅ Done | Step-in via VEH trace maxSteps=1; step-out reads [RSP] + temp BP; step-over = step-in (MVP; CALL detection in future) |
| `SteppingService` (Application) | ✅ Done | PID validation, state tracking, result formatting |
| AI tools | ✅ Done | `StepIn`, `StepOver`, `StepOut`, `ContinueExecution`, `GetSteppingState` in `stepping` category |
| `DebuggerViewModel` | ✅ Done | Async step commands, register/callstack refresh, step history collection, `IsStepping` guard |
| Lua globals | ✅ Done | `debug_stepIn`, `debug_stepOver`, `debug_stepOut`, `debug_continue`, `debug_continueFromBreakpoint` |
| DI wiring | ✅ Done | `ISteppingEngine` + `SteppingService` registered in `App.xaml.cs` |
| Watch expressions | ⏳ Future | Planned stretch goal — deferred to keep scope tight |
| `debug_setLastChanceExceptionHandler` | ⏳ Future | Needs exception handler infrastructure beyond stepping |

### Scripting Compatibility Sprint (S1–S9) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Close the CE Lua API compatibility gap by implementing the Delphi-style property proxy system, form extensions, reactive data binding, and host app interop that real-world CT scripts depend on.

**Result:** 9 sub-phases shipping CE property proxies for all 18 element types, reactive data binding (`element:bind()`), reactive memory watches (`createMemoryWatch()`), `getMainForm()` host interop, dockable script panels, and ILuaFormHost extensions. Lua API parity rose from ~93% to ~96%. Additional fixes: Lua 5.3 bitwise operator preprocessor (fixes BDFFHD scripts), `pcall`/`xpcall`/`error` enabled in sandbox, VEH V3 protocol, 24 new AI tools with lazy loading, TCC build support for VEH agent. 3,000 total tests.

| Sprint | Feature | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| S1 | CE script compat — `{$lua}` alias, CE globals, bit library shim | ✅ Done |
| S2 | CePropertyProxy factory — universal CE property metatable pattern | ✅ Done |
| S3a | CE property proxies — form/element/record Delphi-style `.Caption`, `.Checked`, etc. | ✅ Done |
| S3b | Remaining element property proxies — all 18 element types complete | ✅ Done |
| S4 | CE property proxies for form/element/record (extended) | ✅ Done |
| S5 | ILuaFormHost extensions — form properties, parenting, ElementChanged | ✅ Done |
| S6 | `getMainForm()` proxy — Lua scripts can interact with host app | ✅ Done |
| S7 | Dockable script panels — script-created UI integrates with AvalonDock | ✅ Done |
| S8 | Reactive data binding — `element:bind("Caption", record, "Value")` | ✅ Done |
| S9 | `createMemoryWatch()` — reactive memory monitoring with OnChange | ✅ Done |

**Additional work completed alongside the sprint:**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Lua 5.3 bitwise operator preprocessor | Transpiles `a & b`, `a \| b`, `~a` to `bit.band()` etc. for MoonSharp (Lua 5.2) compat |
| `pcall`/`xpcall`/`error` in sandbox | Required by CE scripts for error handling; previously blocked by sandbox preset |
| VEH V3 protocol | Protocol version bump with lifecycle and conditional BP UI improvements |
| 24 new AI tools | Lazy loading tool categories for token budget compliance |
| TCC build support | VEH native agent compiles with TCC (no Visual Studio Build Tools required) |

---

### Phase 11B — Kernel-Mode Debugging ⏸ SHELVED INDEFINITELY

**Goal:** A signed Windows kernel driver (`CEAISuiteKm.sys`) providing ring-0 capabilities: bypass `ObRegisterCallbacks`-based process access restrictions and anti-debug checks at the kernel level.

**Why shelved:** Kernel access is powerful but niche. Most games CE users target don't have kernel-level anti-debug. Games protected by EAC/BattlEye/Vanguard are a subset of the user base, and those users already know they need kernel tools. The hard external prerequisites (EV cert, WDK, kernel engineer) make this impractical without dedicated resources. Will revisit if demand materializes.

**Complexity:** Very High

**Prerequisites (unchanged):**
- EV code signing certificate (~$500/year + hardware token)
- Dedicated kernel developer familiar with WDK and Windows internals
- Per-Windows-version offset tables for SSDT/`DbgkpXxx` structures
- CI/CD pipeline for kernel binary signing and release
- Compliance review (many anti-cheats blacklist known driver names/hashes)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| `CEAISuite.KernelDriver/` | WDK C project (not C#); three IOCTLs: `OPEN_PROTECTED_PROCESS`, `READ_MEMORY`, `WRITE_MEMORY` |
| `KernelContracts.cs` (Abstractions) | `IKernelDebugger` interface |
| `WindowsKernelBridge` (Engine.Windows) | User-mode bridge communicating with driver via `DeviceIoControl` |
| `KernelDebugService` (Application) | Extends `BreakpointService` with kernel-mode path |

### Phase 11 — Additional Deferred Items

| Item | Original Phase | Why Deferred |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **D3D/OpenGL overlay** (10F) | Phase 10 | Very High complexity, highest crash risk, obsoleted by multi-monitor setups. Better suited as a community plugin via the 10A plugin system. |
| **Multi-platform port** (10H) | Phase 10 | Target audience debugs Windows game processes. Linux/macOS via Wine/Proton is a tiny niche with fundamentally different process model challenges. Cherry on top after the core product is finished, not a prerequisite. |
| **PDB/.NET symbol loading** | Phase 3A | Currently module exports only. Full PDB/DWARF/.NET metadata symbol resolution would enrich disassembler labels, stack traces, and structure dissection. Medium complexity (DbgHelp P/Invoke or similar). Not blocking any workflow — addresses resolve by module+offset — but would significantly improve readability. |
| **`debug_continueFromBreakpoint`** | Scripting S1B | ✅ Done — alias for `debug_continue` in Phase 11A |
| **`debug_setLastChanceExceptionHandler`** | Scripting S1B | Requires exception handler infrastructure from Phase 11A stepping engine. |
| **Lua form anchor/dock layout** | Scripting S2 | Resize-aware element positioning for script-created forms (`element:setAnchors()`). Low ROI — most CE trainers use fixed-size forms. Canvas uses absolute positioning. |
| **Full coroutine `await(promise)` pattern** | Scripting S4 | MoonSharp coroutine integration for true async Lua. `createThread` + `createNativeTimer` cover primary use cases today. |
| **Mono/.NET introspection bridge** | Scripting S6C | CE's most impactful scripting subsystem for modern games. Unity (Mono/IL2CPP) titles dominate the CT community — tested with BDFFHD CT which uses `mono_enumDomains`, `mono_findMethod`, `mono_invoke_method`, `LaunchMonoDataCollector`, and `monopipe`. CE implements this as a native agent DLL injected into the target that hooks the Mono C API (`mono_domain_get`, `mono_class_from_name`, `mono_runtime_invoke`, etc.) and communicates back via named pipe IPC. Our implementation needs: (1) `IMonoEngine` abstraction in Engine.Abstractions, (2) native C agent DLL (similar to VEH agent pattern) that links against Mono runtime exports, (3) named pipe or shared memory IPC channel, (4) ~30 Lua globals (`mono_enumDomains`, `mono_enumAssemblies`, `mono_findClass`, `mono_class_enumFields`, `mono_class_enumMethods`, `mono_findMethod`, `mono_invoke_method`, `mono_getStaticFieldValue`, `mono_setStaticFieldValue`, `LaunchMonoDataCollector`, etc.), (5) `getAddressSafe()` helper (pcall wrapper around `getAddress`), (6) `syntaxcheck` global set by AA engine during validation passes. High value for Unity targets, Very High effort. Could reuse the VEH agent's injection + IPC infrastructure (10E) to reduce bootstrap work. |
| **Integrated Lua script debugger** | Scripting S6E | Set breakpoints in Lua code, step through scripts in Script Editor, variable inspector. Needs MoonSharp `IDebugger` rework. |
| **`assemble()` byte extraction** | Scripting audit | Currently returns `true` not assembled bytes. Needs Keystone byte extraction without full AA execution context. |
| **`AOBScanModule` range-constrained scan** | Scripting audit | Currently scans all memory then filters. Needs `IScanEngine` start/end address constraint support for performance. |
| **Script library manager UI** | Scripting S3 | ViewModel + XAML panel for browsing installed script modules in `scripts/lib/`. |

| **Phase 11A** | Debugger stepping | ✅ Done | ISteppingEngine via VEH TF; 5 AI tools, Lua globals, DebuggerViewModel wired |
| **Compat Sprint** | S1–S9 | ✅ Done | CE property proxies, reactive binding, memory watches, getMainForm(), Lua 5.3 compat |
| **Phase 11B** | Kernel driver | ⏸ Shelved | Niche; requires EV cert + dedicated kernel engineer |

| **Overall** | **~91%** | **~94%** | **~95%** | **~96%** | **95%+** |

*Process & Attachment parity improves further with future engine enhancements (parent process, command line).
**Scripting (Lua API) at 96%: ~170+ globals registered. CE property proxies, reactive binding, memory watches, getMainForm(), Lua 5.3 bitwise compat, pcall/xpcall/error. Remaining 4% = mono/.NET introspection bridge (~30 globals). Real-world CT testing (BDFFHD v4) showed 3 of 4 scripts depend on mono introspection — Unity titles dominate the CT ecosystem, making this the highest-impact remaining Lua API gap.

Compat Sprint parity changes: Scripting (Lua API) 93% → 96% (property proxies, reactive binding, memory watches, host interop). Overall ~95% → ~96%. Now exceeds 95%+ target for all categories except Process & Attachment (50%), Pointer Resolution (70%), Session & History (75%), Safety & Watchdog (75%), and Disassembly & Analysis (80%).

*Full historical parity table (Phases 2–8) preserved in git history.*
